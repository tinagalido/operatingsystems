A. Features

    1. Identifying the problem

    - Why are there missing keys with 2 or more threads, but not with 1 thread?
    - Investigate and identify the sequence of events that lead to missing keys for 2 and
        4 threads but not for 1 thread.

    2. Implementing the locks
    - Insert lock and unlock statements in put and get to ensure that the number of keys
        missing is always 0
    - Use pthread calls for locking and unlocking

B. Compiling and Running

    1. Compiling the program
        
        To compile the program, execute the following:

        user@ubuntu22:~$ make

        gcc  ph.c -o a2.out

    2. Running the program

        Before running the program, make sure there is a generated file after successful compilation. In this case, it should be "a2.out" file. 
        To run the program, execute the following according to the following format
        
        Format: make <numberOfThreads>
        
        where numberOfThreads = number of threads (run1 for 1 thread, run2 for 2 threads, etc.)

        user@ubuntu22:~$ make run1

        ./a2.out 1
        0: put time = 5.809688
        0: lookup time = 14.645099
        0: 0 keys missing
        completion time = 20.455509

        Result: The put time, lookup time, completion time will be displayed. The keys missing will also be displayed

        Note: Run the following command to clean the out file.

        user@ubuntu22:~$ make clean

C. Testing

    1. To run or test for 2 threads:

        ./a2.out 2
        0: put time = 10.004726
        1: put time = 10.496859
        0: lookup time = 45.398219
        0: 0 keys missing
        1: lookup time = 46.967151
        1: 0 keys missing
        completion time = 57.464849

    2. To run or test for 4 threads:

        ./a2.out 4
        3: put time = 6.434560
        2: put time = 8.775954
        1: put time = 8.910787
        0: put time = 8.972762
        2: lookup time = 69.331872
        2: 0 keys missing
        1: lookup time = 75.700126
        1: 0 keys missing
        3: lookup time = 76.305594
        3: 0 keys missing
        0: lookup time = 78.968910
        0: 0 keys missing
        completion time = 87.945022
